## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **‚öôÔ∏è Architecture**     | The codebase follows a modular architecture, with separate files for different functionalities. It utilizes a GUI for image processing and text annotation. The system follows a simple and straightforward design. |
| **üìñ Documentation**   | The documentation is limited and could be improved. There is a need for more detailed comments and function-level documentation to enhance code comprehension. |
| **üîó Dependencies**    | The system relies on external libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, and PyTorch for image processing, character recognition, and GUI functionality. All the dependencies are clearly defined and easy to install. |
| **üß© Modularity**      | The codebase is organized into separate files for different functionalities ‚Äì main.py, gui.py, and utils.py. Each file focuses on a specific aspect of image processing and text annotation and can be easily maintained or extended. |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Testing**          | There is no mention of specific testing strategies or tools being used in the codebase. The absence of tests can impact long-term stability and maintainability. Implementing tests would be beneficial for code quality. |
| **‚ö°Ô∏è Performance**      | Given the nature of the system, performance may vary depending on the size and complexity of the image being processed. However, since the codebase utilizes popular and efficient libraries for image processing, it should generally perform satisfactorily. |
| **üîê Security**        | The codebase does not appear to have specific security measures since its primary focus is on image processing and text annotation. It may have limited security vulnerabilities related to file access, but that would depend on the server environment in which it is deployed. |
| **üîÄ Version Control** | The codebase utilizes Git for version control and is hosted on GitHub. While it is not explicitly mentioned how the repository is managed, Git provides features like branching, tagging, and merge management that can be utilized for effective version control. |
| **üîå Integrations**    | The system does not have explicit integrations with other systems or services based on the information provided. It is a stand-alone image processing and text annotation tool. |
| **üì∂ Scalability**     | It is unclear from the provided information how well the system can handle growth. Factors like performance optimization, parallelization, and distributed processing should be considered to assess scalability. More information would be needed to evaluate it effectively. |

| [main.py](https://github.com/Maorazr/ImageProcessing/blob/main/src/main.py)     | The code imports the required modules,'OrderedDict' from'collections', and all the functions from a module called'utils'. It defines a function called'main', which calls a function'gui'. The'main' function is executed only if the script is run directly as the main program.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [gui.py](https://github.com/Maorazr/ImageProcessing/blob/main/src/gui.py)       | The code snippet is implementing a function that sorts an array of integers. It uses a popular sorting algorithm called bubble sort, where it repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [utiils.py](https://github.com/Maorazr/ImageProcessing/blob/main/src/utiils.py) | This code snippet defines a Tech Lead class and implements functions for image processing and text annotation. It includes a neural network model for character recognition, methods for cropping letters from images and generating words from the recognized characters. It also includes GUI functionality for loading and annotating images either by clicking or typing words. The code utilizes libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and PyTorch. |
